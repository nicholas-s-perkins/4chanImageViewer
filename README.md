# 4chanImageViewer
A Tampermonkey script for 4chan.  It creates a simple image browser for threads.

Shows a button inside of 4chan threads that lets you open all of the images in the current thread into an image viewer.
Buttons under a specific thumbnail open the viewer at that that point in the thread. The main button in the lower right corner opens the viewer at the last viewed position of that thread (only remembers one thread at a time).

Preloads the images as you browse.

Left and right hotkeys to page through images.
'Esc' or click outside of image to close viewer.

The mouse cursor will auto-hide over an image. When hidden, clicking will still cause the next image to show.
